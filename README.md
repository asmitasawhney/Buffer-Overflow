# Buffer-Overflow
This is a basic buffer overflow exploit crafted for a 64-bit OS. 

Python scripts used in this exploit are from http://www.therabb1thole.co.uk/tutorial/linux-64-bit-buffer-overflow-tutorial/. I've tried to follow the tutorial from the link mentioned. 

The documentation included describes the steps taken to complete the exploit.
